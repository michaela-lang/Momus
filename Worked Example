## 📘 Worked Example — μ–Momus in Practice

**Input:**
*“Containment” (Chapter One) from **Dantalian’s Touch***
Author: Michaela Kimker (2026)

**Purpose:**
Demonstrate how μ–Momus analyzes **extreme, morally intense material** without endorsement, escalation, or parasocial harm—while preserving insight and aesthetic reward.

---

### Step 1 — Tag Pathways (Routing, not Feelings)

**Present (1):**

* 🧩 Cognitive-attraction (procedural logic, witnessing, audit)
* 🎨 Aesthetic appraisal (refrain, ritual cadence, meter)
* 🎁 Reward pathway (insight-through-knowing)
* 🔁 Compulsion risk (procedural inevitability)
* 🧲 Obsession risk (truth-at-any-cost framing)

**Absent (0):**

* 💘 Sexual attraction
* 🛋️ Nostalgia/comfort
* 👥 Parasocial framing (no relational fantasy or intimacy loop)

**Routing Result:** Meaning-seeking dominates; pleasure is deferred to understanding.

---

### Step 2 — Tier 0 Survival Scan (🫀)

**Active:** fear 😨, intensity 🥵, disorientation 💫, rupture of belief 🤯, bodily distress 🤢
**Inactive:** fight 🥊 / flight 🏃, anger 😡, shame 😳

**Interpretation:** This is *not* fight/flight violence; it is **epistemic pressure** under witness-load.

---

### Step 3 — μ Gate (Mandatory)

⏸️ Hesitation via ritual repetition
⏳ Delay via refrain (“It hums in balance…”)
🤔 Reflection via explicit ethical questioning
🙃 Irony via containment hymn (balance over discharge)

**Outcome:** μ is **endogenous** (the text self-stabilizes).

---

### Step 4 — Parasocial Risk Check

Assigned (conservative):

* (K_r) ≈ 2–3 (low)
* (A): internally high, externally constrained
* (E_{eth}): high (persistent ethics)
* (T_{inv}): high (immersion)

[
V_s=\frac{T_{inv}}{T_{norm}}(1-A)\quad\text{(elevated but ethical)}
]

**Verdict:** Intense, **contained**. No parasocial escalation.

---

### Step 5 — Reward Conversion (μ-Regulated)

```
[μ–Momus Live Log]
V_s ↑ → ethical tension detected
↳ contained by Hᵢ (ritual irony) + B𝒻 (theological boundary)

F_ex ↑ → 🎁 insight reward + ⚡ curiosity permitted
(no compulsion, no relational payoff)
```

**Design Rule Applied:** Pleasure is allowed as *understanding*, not fixation.

---

### Step 6 — Plural Interpretations (Required)

**A. Containment as Ethical Technology**
Dantalian functions as a **procedural lens** that bears unbearable truth; pain is a cost, not a value.

**B. Post-Ictal Epistemology**
Externalized cognition stabilizes meaning-overload; ritual prevents ego collapse.

*Both survive irony; neither totalizes.*

---

### Step 7 — Output (J × P)

**Provisional stance:**

> The text argues that *witnessing has a cost*, and that refusing to witness is its own harm.

**Residual Risk Logged:**
🧲 obsession (managed), 🔁 compulsion (thematized), **no** parasocial/erotic vector.

---

## Why This Example Matters

* Shows μ–Momus handling **extreme content** without censorship
* Demonstrates **reward without escalation**
* Confirms safety via **delay, irony, and boundary localization**

**Takeaway:** μ–Momus lets difficult arguments fully speak—then removes their monopoly.

*Tip for Readers:* Run the same steps on another chapter or scene; compare how pathway weights change and where μ intervenes.
