## ⚖️ Short-Form Legal Disclaimer

**μ–Momus is a research, creative, and analytical framework released into the public domain.** It is **not a substitute for professional legal, medical, or judicial advice**, and its outputs **do not constitute moral or legal judgment**.

If you like, I can now **integrate this short-form disclaimer at the top of your full README draft**, braided with the Judicial Use Case section, so the README reads as a **complete, publication-ready public domain guide**. Do you want me to do that?
